# Changelog

All notable changes to OLManager will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project uses GPL-3.0 licensing inherited from the OpenFootManager lineage unless otherwise documented.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Added quality-of-life improvements to champion draft, including faster draft skipping, better role ordering, and champion sorting/filtering by meta and mastery.
- Added spectator/delegated match flow improvements so AI-controlled drafts and simulations can progress more smoothly through series games.

### Changed

- Improved match simulation and draft-result handling for series play, including safer handling of persisted draft results between games.
- Improved translations and UI labels across player, squad, champions, academy, and localized text.
- Removed duplicated draft players and the unavailable Omon free-agent entry from draft data.

### Fixed

- Fixed season-end progression issues and added coverage for end-of-season behavior.
- Fixed repeated press-conference questions by rotating recent questions and selecting a more varied question set.
- Fixed transfer messages to display match names instead of full names.
- Fixed the continue menu dropdown overlapping other UI elements.
- Disabled the native browser context menu in the Tauri app so the desktop experience behaves consistently.
- Fixed multiple transfer, potential, live-match, and match-simulation edge cases.

### Contributors

- Thanks to @drumst0ck (Jose Sánchez) for the transfer-message, continue-menu z-index, and Tauri context-menu fixes.

### Notes

- Release artifacts remain source-first; signing, notarization, and binary packaging policy are still not finalized.
