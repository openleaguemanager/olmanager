# Changelog

All notable changes to OLManager will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project uses GPL-3.0 licensing inherited from the OpenFootManager lineage unless otherwise documented.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Added ScheduleCalendarView to display selected scrims with opponent name and logo when a scrim opponent is configured.
- Added realistic board objectives based on team strength: objectives are now generated based on the roster's average skill compared to the rest of the league, not static reputation thresholds.
- Added end-of-season board objective review message with objectives completed count and satisfaction delta.
- Added visible gold advantage chart with proper LoL-style formatting (blue advantage rises, red advantage falls) and chronological timeline plotting.
- Added i18n keys for board objective review messages (`be.msg.boardObjectiveReview.subject`, `be.msg.boardObjectiveReview.body`).
- Added roster destination selection for new signings: users can now choose to assign a new signing to either the Main Team or the Academy squad.
- Added updated world data with recalibrated player statistics and market costs.

### Changed

- Restyled the post-match gold advantage chart with improved visuals: gradient line, side-colored segments (blue above center, orange below center), final advantage summary, and peak display.
- Adapted tournament and schedule standings tables to LoL format: removed "drawn" column and "points", replaced goals with "Maps" (e.g., "12-4") and "Map Diff" (e.g., "+8", "-3").
- Changed series objective calculation to use roster skill comparison: strong teams get title-contender objectives, mid-table teams get playoff objectives, weak teams get survival objectives.
- NeutralTimersState now uses typed fallbacks instead of empty objects to satisfy TypeScript requirements.
- Refactored world data loading: the system now reads world data exclusively from `lec_world.json`.
- Improved Draft AI logic: refined pick selection to prevent nonsensical choices and ensure bans do not target roles already picked.

### Fixed

- Fixed Bo3/Bo5 series completion: the series now correctly detects when a team reaches the required wins (2 for Bo3, 3 for Bo5) and ends appropriately.
- Fixed Bo3 one-map finalization bug: added a hard invariant requiring both reaching target wins AND having enough played maps to support that score.
- Fixed stale series advance button label: after a Bo3/Bo5 completes, the button now shows "Continue" instead of a stale "Game 2/3" label.
- Fixed final series scoreboard reset: the 2-1 or 3-x final score now persists and displays correctly after series completion instead of resetting to 0-0.
- Fixed press conference availability: press conference is now correctly gated to only appear for single games or completed series, not for in-progress Bo3/Bo5.
- Fixed NeutralTimersState TypeScript error: added typed fallback helpers (`createEmptyNeutralTimersState`, `createDefaultObjectivesState`) to satisfy type requirements.
- Fixed missing handleStartGame function that prevented creating a new career after finishing a previous one.
- Fixed board objective end-of-season feedback: objectives now trigger a visible inbox message with results and satisfaction changes.
- Fixed football/soccer terminology in initial season objectives email: replaced football terms (matches, goals, top half) with LoL/esports terms (split, series, maps, LEC table).
- Fixed gold advantage chart trajectory: the chart now correctly plots blue advantage going up, red advantage going down, and crossing the centerline appropriately.
- Fixed standings table format: converted from soccer-style (drawn, goals for/against, points) to LoL-style (played, won, lost, maps, map difference) in both TournamentsTab and ScheduleTab.
- Fixed position swapping during the draft phase: players can now correctly change positions and roles.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-28

### Added

### Fixed

- Fixed repeated press-conference questions by rotating recent questions and selecting a more varied question set.
