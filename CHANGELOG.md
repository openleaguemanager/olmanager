# Changelog

All notable changes to OLManager will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project uses GPL-3.0 licensing inherited from the OpenFootManager lineage unless otherwise documented.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- Added GitHub tarball data import, replacing the deprecated OLMDBManager external platform. The game now downloads game data directly from `OpenLeagueManager/olmanager-data` via `codeload.github.com` (no auth, no rate limits). Thanks @aalonsolopez.
- Added bundled game data as an offline fallback. A fresh install works without internet on first run, and the online import provides updates when available. Data is resolved through a 7-tier path chain (dev, bundled resource, imported). Thanks @aalonsolopez.
- Added global image error fallback: any broken player or staff photo is replaced with the default placeholder instead of showing the browser's broken-image icon. Thanks @aalonsolopez.

### Changed

- Moved the `data/` directory to a git submodule pointing to `github.com/OpenLeagueManager/olmanager-data`, decoupling game data versioning from the application codebase. Thanks @aalonsolopez.
- Switched the auto-import pipeline from OLMDBManager ZIP downloads to GitHub tarball extraction using `tar` + `flate2` crates, with 6 passing Rust unit tests. Thanks @aalonsolopez.
- Simplified bundled-resource path resolution: removed the Tauri `_up_` prefix hack in favor of direct `resource_dir/data` paths, fixing Android compatibility without affecting desktop builds. Thanks @aalonsolopez.
- Updated all CI workflows (build, PR, release) to clone submodules automatically via `submodules: true` in 10 checkout steps across 3 pipelines. Thanks @aalonsolopez.
- Separated auto-import and manual-ZIP cache paths to prevent format corruption: auto-import writes to `olmanager_export.tar.gz`, manual ZIP import writes to `olmanager_export.zip`. Thanks @aalonsolopez.

### Fixed

- Fixed player photos showing as broken images in production builds: the asset resolver now checks bundled `resource_dir` paths, making the 2193 committed player photos available without requiring an online import. Thanks @aalonsolopez. (#352)
- Fixed Android builds failing to find game data on fresh installs by using direct `resource_dir/data` paths instead of the Tauri `_up_` prefix, which did not resolve correctly on Android. Thanks @aalonsolopez.
- Fixed economy i18n texts that inherited weekly terminology from the football-era prototype: contract wages now display as annual (`€/yr`, `€/año`, `€/ano`, `€/an`, `€/Jahr`, `€/anno`, `€/yl`), sponsor deals use one-time payments, and the runway indicator correctly shows months in all 8 supported languages. Thanks @aalonsolopez.
- Fixed football-era "training ground" / "campo de entrenamiento" references in sponsor messages, replaced with esports-appropriate "club banners" / "carteles del club" across all languages. Thanks @aalonsolopez.
- Fixed German `weeklyTotal` label incorrectly showing "Wöchentliche Gesamt" instead of "Jährliche Gesamt". Thanks @aalonsolopez.
- Fixed missing filter options for player search in multiple languages, restoring the filter UI labels across all supported locales. Thanks @aalonsolopez.
- Fixed generated player names falling back to emergency placeholders in roster generation by using plausible names when the catalog has no direct match. Thanks @aalonsolopez.
- Fixed issue #306 multi-league cleanup: removed dead standalone playoff generators, hardened `competition_id_from_team_id` against dashed competition/team IDs with manifest-aware prefix matching, and added safe clearing/derivation of legacy/unknown competition references during save load and refresh. Thanks @aalonsolopez.
- Fixed empty/failed competition scans destructively clearing all competition references: `sanitize_competition_references` now no-ops when no known competition ids are available. Thanks @aalonsolopez.
- Fixed stale `competition_configs` surviving save load: both `load_game` and `select_team` now clear the map before inserting current non-legacy manifests. Thanks @aalonsolopez.
- Fixed stale `cargo test -p olm_core` integration tests by updating `League`/`InboxMessage` initializers, correcting `ofm_core`/`domain::` module paths, and aligning contract/facility test expectations. Thanks @aalonsolopez.
- Fixed bot lane path routing in the live simulator so minions and champions no longer cross the closed wall near the dragon pit. Thanks @aalonsolopez.
- Fixed delegated-renewal frontend tests/fixtures to expect annual wage suffixes (`/yr`, `/ano`) instead of weekly. Thanks @aalonsolopez.

### Contributors

- Thanks to @aalonsolopez for the data infrastructure migration, GitHub import system, cross-platform fixes, i18n corrections, image fallback improvements, roster generation fixes, and player-search localization in this release.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- Added UI v2 as the only supported interface, replacing the legacy `src/components`, `src/pages` and `App.tsx` entry points with the new `src/ui-v2` shell, dashboard, pages and shadcn primitives. Thanks @NicoRuedaA, @joselaguilarhz and @aalonsolopez.
- Added native v2 dashboard tabs for Home, Squad, Players, Tactics, Training, SoloQ, Scrims, Scouting, Transfers, Market, Staff, Finances, Facilities, Youth, Inbox, Competitions, Teams, Meta and Manager workflows. Thanks @NicoRuedaA and @joselaguilarhz.
- Added keyboard/controller-style navigation across the main menu, league picker, team selection, dashboard sidebar, save list, create-manager form, nationality dropdown, community panel, patch notes and settings tabs. Thanks @NicoRuedaA.
- Added multi-league and multi-competition foundations: competition manifests, active competition routing, background league simulation, academy leagues, region/tier filtering, split tracking and save/load support for all leagues. Thanks @NicoRuedaA.
- Added competition browser views with standings, teams, players and all-competition calendar support. Thanks @NicoRuedaA and @joselaguilarhz.
- Added OLMDBManager-powered data import flows, including native desktop auto-import, manual local `.zip` import, cached re-import, progress reporting and safe staging/rollback. Thanks @joselaguilarhz and @NicoRuedaA.
- Added clickable staff profiles: staff cards now open a dedicated profile view with attributes, role-based gameplay impact, photo, nationality, contract details and hire/release actions. Thanks @joselaguilarhz.
- Added web/server foundations: adapter-based API layer, Supabase auth/profile/save persistence, server-side world assembly, WebSocket live match simulation and command parity groundwork. Thanks @NicoRuedaA and @joselaguilarhz.
- Added Discord Rich Presence integration with OLManager assets and activity states. Thanks @Juan / @TtvNekix.
- Added in-app bug report ZIP export to Desktop. Thanks @NicoRuedaA.
- Added a richer message/inbox system with sender metadata, trigger-based templates, high-density media messages and localized variations. Thanks @NicoRuedaA.
- Added social content foundations: JSON-backed templates, matchup conditions, avatar resolution and league-aware placeholders. Thanks @chasemrs.
- Added AI team-agent systems for roster stability, renewals, sales, purchases, strategic recruitment, free-agent signings and player-agent satisfaction decisions. Thanks @aalonsolopez.

- Added real SoloQ rank emblem assets and default staff imagery. Thanks @NicoRuedaA.
- Added new release-candidate build workflow for artifact generation. Thanks @aalonsolopez.

### Changed

- UI v2 is now the production UI: the old v1 toggle was removed, legacy code survives only under `src/ui-v2/_legacy` for wrappers that still need it, and `src/main.tsx` renders `AppV2` directly. Thanks @NicoRuedaA and @joselaguilarhz.
- Reworked the main menu into a game-style OLManager experience with champion splash slideshow, community/patch-notes panels, settings tabs, persistent navigation and version display. Thanks @joselaguilarhz.
- Reorganized shared frontend helpers into `src/lib`, including domain-specific modules for common helpers, dashboard, finance, formatting, home, inbox, players, schedule, scouting, scrims, season, social, squad, staff, teams, training and transfers. Thanks @NicoRuedaA and @joselaguilarhz.
- Consolidated core game logic into `olm_core`, unified command dispatch and moved academy, scrim, team-talk, time-blocker and OVR logic behind shared core seams. Thanks @NicoRuedaA.
- Reworked save persistence toward a single-file gzipped JSON format with diagnostics, format-version pruning and safer serialization checks. Thanks @NicoRuedaA.
- Reworked transfer-market behavior for AI teams, contract expiry, signing policy, player swaps, free agents, academy releases and own-club transfer/loan actions. Thanks @aalonsolopez, @NicoRuedaA, @TtvNekix and @mezxR.
- Staff are now shown by their esports nickname (e.g. "Zetz", "ZalFIRE"), falling back to the real name when no nickname is available. Thanks @joselaguilarhz.
- World (MUNDO) sidebar counters now reflect the real competitive world, excluding seeded youth-academy teams and their generated players so the totals match the imported catalog. Thanks @NicoRuedaA.
- Team roster now shows player OVR for every team, not only the user's own team. Thanks @joselaguilarhz.
- Added migration v056 introducing a `nickname` column on the staff table; existing saves are backfilled from the imported catalog on load. Thanks @joselaguilarhz.
- Replaced the financial system's weekly processing model with monthly processing and ledger-backed stabilization. Thanks @NicoRuedaA and @aalonsolopez.
- Updated data/catalog architecture around competition registries, team/player/staff image fields, competition-scoped repositories and OLMDBManager exports. Thanks @NicoRuedaA and @joselaguilarhz.
- Removed the football-era injury availability system and other football-specific dead code. Thanks @aalonsolopez, @NicoRuedaA and @joselaguilarhz.
- Improved the visual design system with zinc/orange v2 tokens, new background atmosphere utilities, page animations, Oswald/Barlow-style heading treatment, progress bars, scrollbars and better player/profile visuals. Thanks @NicoRuedaA and @joselaguilarhz.
- Migrated native v2 hardcoded strings to i18next and refreshed locale files across supported languages. Thanks @aalonsolopez, @NicoRuedaA, @chasemrs and @mezxR.
- Updated active world data, competition manifests, rosters, staff, champion assets and splash lists from current OLMDBManager/catalog sources. Thanks @NicoRuedaA and @joselaguilarhz.

### Fixed

- Fixed production data loading across Tauri installation layouts by resolving resources from executable-relative/resource paths instead of stale development locations. Thanks @NicoRuedaA and @joselaguilarhz.
- Fixed save compatibility and rehydration issues, including missing competition IDs, stale team assignments, missing teams/players, malformed player exports, null data fields and old incompatible saves. Thanks @NicoRuedaA and @joselaguilarhz.
- Fixed season and split progression issues: active league resolution, split summaries, playoff scheduling, first-day scrim setup, skip-to-match-day blockers and season preview filtering now respect the user's competition. Thanks @NicoRuedaA and @chasemrs.
- Fixed board objective scope and map-objective caps so objectives are based on the active league and winnable map totals. Thanks @aalonsolopez.
- Fixed match result mapping for press conferences and canonical score handling after live simulation/runtime winner resolution. Thanks @NicoRuedaA and @aalonsolopez.
- Imported staff now appear correctly inside active games: fixed `wage: null` (and other null fields) dropping entire staff files during parsing, and the active game's staff are now rehydrated from the imported catalog. Thanks @joselaguilarhz.
- The dashboard now refreshes the active game after an import, so newly imported players/teams/staff appear without restarting the app. Thanks @joselaguilarhz and @NicoRuedaA.
- Fixed background competition schedule generation to use `user_competition_id` and executable-relative paths. Thanks @NicoRuedaA.
- Replaced the legacy draft result screen with `DraftResultScreenV2` in match simulation. Thanks @NicoRuedaA.
- Fixed draft and champion UI issues: broken LEC logo fallback, champion splash naming, assistant-coach photos, draft-result crashes, ban icons, champion tile grids and champion-page navigation. Thanks @NicoRuedaA and @joselaguilarhz.
- Fixed condition and stamina behavior so condition affects the match engine and recovery respects post-training fatigue while reducing match stamina depletion. Thanks @joselaguilarhz and @NicoRuedaA.
- Fixed player data and display issues, including date-of-birth parsing, natural positions, null defaults, OVR refresh on load, player photos, real-name/IGN swaps, nationality flags and profile attributes without scout reports. Thanks @NicoRuedaA, @joselaguilarhz and @aalonsolopez.
- Fixed transfer-market table layout, SoloQ tier thresholds, nationality translations, SoloQ badges, action/status column alignment and navigation conflicts in v2 transfer views. Thanks @NicoRuedaA.
- Fixed UI v2 overflow, old-theme remnants and layout issues across match screens, pre-match setup, live match, Schedule, Youth, Staff, Transfers, Champion grid, Tactics and Home lineup cards. Thanks @NicoRuedaA, @joselaguilarhz and @aalonsolopez.
- Fixed inbox/message actions, effect toasts, mood-report translations, event action button translations and removed obsolete international call-up/charity-match content. Thanks @chasemrs.
- Fixed web/server crashes and command gaps around dashboard routing, finance/competitions/training imports, academy persistence, scrim context, stats overview, transfer bids and imported player/photo data. Thanks @NicoRuedaA and @joselaguilarhz.
- Fixed build, package and release-candidate validation blockers, including Rust package checks, current core-model tests, legacy test mocks, v2 color-token expectations and Tauri/Vite localhost issues. Thanks @aalonsolopez and @chasemrs.
- Fixed Android/build configuration issues and desktop window/icon configuration problems. Thanks @chasemrs, @NicoRuedaA and @Juan / @TtvNekix.

### Chores

- Removed the failed web implementation from the desktop release path, the legacy HTTP server crate, unused world IO, stale theme/avatar/profile commands, debug tooling and obsolete `world.json` references. Thanks @NicoRuedaA and @joselaguilarhz.
- Added and maintained Playwright E2E coverage for the main game flow, dashboard loading, tab navigation, advance-time, squad, training, schedule, settings and save/load flows. Thanks @NicoRuedaA.
- Updated documentation for dashboard architecture, inbox/message architecture, data model, web migration planning, UI v2 handoff, release process and data/attribute references. Thanks @NicoRuedaA, @joselaguilarhz and @aalonsolopez.
- Cleaned repository state after merge/rebase conflicts, removed dead files and synchronized generated asset manifests, Cargo lockfiles and locale data. Thanks @NicoRuedaA, @joselaguilarhz and @aalonsolopez.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Added ScheduleCalendarView to display selected scrims with opponent name and logo when a scrim opponent is configured.
- Added realistic board objectives based on team strength: objectives are now generated based on the roster's average skill compared to the rest of the league, not static reputation thresholds.
- Added end-of-season board objective review message with objectives completed count and satisfaction delta.
- Added visible gold advantage chart with proper LoL-style formatting (blue advantage rises, red advantage falls) and chronological timeline plotting.
- Added i18n keys for board objective review messages (`be.msg.boardObjectiveReview.subject`, `be.msg.boardObjectiveReview.body`).
- Added roster destination selection for new signings: users can now choose to assign a new signing to either the Main Team or the Academy squad.
- Added updated world data with recalibrated player statistics and market costs.

### Changed

- Restyled the post-match gold advantage chart with improved visuals: gradient line, side-colored segments (blue above center, orange below center), final advantage summary, and peak display.
- Adapted tournament and schedule standings tables to LoL format: removed "drawn" column and "points", replaced goals with "Maps" (e.g., "12-4") and "Map Diff" (e.g., "+8", "-3").
- Changed series objective calculation to use roster skill comparison: strong teams get title-contender objectives, mid-table teams get playoff objectives, weak teams get survival objectives.
- NeutralTimersState now uses typed fallbacks instead of empty objects to satisfy TypeScript requirements.
- Refactored world data loading: the system now reads world data exclusively from `lec_world.json`.
- Improved Draft AI logic: refined pick selection to prevent nonsensical choices and ensure bans do not target roles already picked.

### Fixed

- Fixed Bo3/Bo5 series completion: the series now correctly detects when a team reaches the required wins (2 for Bo3, 3 for Bo5) and ends appropriately.
- Fixed Bo3 one-map finalization bug: added a hard invariant requiring both reaching target wins AND having enough played maps to support that score.
- Fixed stale series advance button label: after a Bo3/Bo5 completes, the button now shows "Continue" instead of a stale "Game 2/3" label.
- Fixed final series scoreboard reset: the 2-1 or 3-x final score now persists and displays correctly after series completion instead of resetting to 0-0.
- Fixed press conference availability: press conference is now correctly gated to only appear for single games or completed series, not for in-progress Bo3/Bo5.
- Fixed NeutralTimersState TypeScript error: added typed fallback helpers (`createEmptyNeutralTimersState`, `createDefaultObjectivesState`) to satisfy type requirements.
- Fixed missing handleStartGame function that prevented creating a new career after finishing a previous one.
- Fixed board objective end-of-season feedback: objectives now trigger a visible inbox message with results and satisfaction changes.
- Fixed football/soccer terminology in initial season objectives email: replaced football terms (matches, goals, top half) with LoL/esports terms (split, series, maps, LEC table).
- Fixed gold advantage chart trajectory: the chart now correctly plots blue advantage going up, red advantage going down, and crossing the centerline appropriately.
- Fixed standings table format: converted from soccer-style (drawn, goals for/against, points) to LoL-style (played, won, lost, maps, map difference) in both TournamentsTab and ScheduleTab.
- Fixed position swapping during the draft phase: players can now correctly change positions and roles.

### Contributors

- Thanks to @drumst0ck (Jose Sánchez) for the NeutralTimersState TypeScript fix, amd the help in changing some content in the events of the game to use real media!
